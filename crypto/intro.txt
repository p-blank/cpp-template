Hello
I am a student at IIITL, pursuing B. Tech degree with Information Technlogy Background

I like working in a fast paced manner.

I love problem solving, especially the ones related to data structures and algorithms.

that is why one of my favorite hobbies are competing in coding contests held on codeforces and codechef.

I have ranked under 150 multiple times on codechef, and was able to qualify for Onsite regionals of ACM ICPC 2020.

also, I am very passionate about building something that can make an impact on the world.

I believe my engineering skills, my experience in algorithms and data structures, 
and my problem solving skills would make me an ideal candidate for this position.
