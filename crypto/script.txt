Hello everyone

You must be wondering why is a global identity system required, when things are already functioning fine without it.

well, things are not very transparent to the customers, and many service providers exploit user's info without consent.
This global identity system will enable customers to share only the information they permit for the process of authentication,

But what is authentication?

It is a process by which it is determined, that a person is showing his genuine identity or not.

In this slide you can see some of the most common authentication methods like password, 2-factor, etc.

Now, what is the problem with such authentication systems:

	-Service providers need to maintain their own database for storing user's information. 
	This costs a lot of infrastructure.
	
	-It is inefficient since, the data is duplicated accross all servers accross different service providers
	
	-Even the 2-factor authentication is not very secure as many apps maintain access to user's sms inbox, 
	and a small breach can lead an OTP to leak.
	
	-It is cumbursome to users, because they need to remembers credentials for every place they have an account
	
	-User's personal information can be exploited in many ways without their consent.
	
Now, what is the solution to this problem? And does it even exist?

Yes, there is a solution, the blockchain based global identity system.

And, Saksham will tell you the idea behind this solution.
